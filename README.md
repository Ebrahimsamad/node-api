# Posts API

This project is a Node.js-based RESTful API for managing posts. It provides endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting posts. The API is secured with authentication middleware, ensuring that only authorized users can interact with the posts.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Secure API endpoints with middleware to authenticate users.
